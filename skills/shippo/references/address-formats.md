# Address Formats

Shippo uses two address field naming conventions (v1 and v2) depending on the endpoint. This document clarifies which format to use where.

---

## V1 Field Names

Used by: `shipments-create` (inline addresses), `batches-create`, `addresses-create-v1`, `manifests-create`, `orders-create`

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Full name |
| `company` | No | Company name |
| `street1` | Yes | Street address line 1 |
| `street2` | No | Apt, suite, unit, etc. |
| `street3` | No | Additional address line |
| `city` | Yes | City |
| `state` | Depends | State/province (required for US, CA, AU; optional for many other countries) |
| `zip` | Depends | Postal code (required for most countries; not used by some, e.g., IE, HK) |
| `country` | Yes | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |
| `phone` | No* | Phone number |
| `email` | No* | Email address |
| `is_residential` | No | Boolean, whether the address is residential |

*Phone and email are required for international shipments (carriers need them for customs processing).

## V2 Field Names

Used by: `addresses-create-v2`, `addresses-validate-v2`

Returned by: `addresses-parse`

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Full name |
| `company` | No | Company name |
| `address_line_1` | Yes | Street address line 1 |
| `address_line_2` | No | Apt, suite, unit, etc. |
| `address_line_3` | No | Additional address line |

| `country_code` | Yes | ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code |
| `phone` | No* | Phone number |
| `email` | No* | Email address |
| `is_residential` | No | Boolean |

### V2 Address Example (for addresses-create-v2)

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "address_line_1": "731 Market St",
  "address_line_2": "#200",
  "city_locality": "San Francisco",
  "state_province": "CA",
  "postal_code": "94103",
  "country_code": "US",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-123-4567"
}
```

## Parse Response Format

`addresses-parse` returns v2 field names **without** `country_code` (the parser does not infer country). You must add the country yourself before passing to `addresses-create-v2` or converting to v1 for `shipments-create`.

Example parse response fields:
```json
{
  "address_line_1": "731 Market St",
  "address_line_2": "#200",
  "city_locality": "San Francisco",
  "state_province": "CA",
  "postal_code": "94103"
}
```

## Converting Between V1 and V2

When you get a parse result (v2) and need to use it in `shipments-create` (v1):

| V2 Field | V1 Field |
|---|---|
| `address_line_1` | `street1` |
| `address_line_2` | `street2` |
| `address_line_3` | `street3` |
| `city_locality` | `city` |
| `state_province` | `state` |
| `postal_code` | `zip` |
| `country_code` | `country` |

`name`, `company`, `phone`, `email`, and `is_residential` use the same field name in both versions.
