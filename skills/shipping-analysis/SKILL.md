# Shipping Analysis and Optimization

## Geographic Cost Analysis

1. Confirm origin address, destination list (or use representative cities), and parcel details.
2. Call `carrier-accounts-list` to see configured carriers.
3. Call `shipments-create` per destination to collect rates. Creating shipments is free; only `transactions-create` costs money.
4. Write results to `analysis/` directory (markdown report + CSV). Columns: Route, Destination, Carrier, Service, Cost, Currency, EstimatedDays, Zone.

## Package Optimization

1. Confirm the route.
2. Define dimension profiles to test (or use user-provided ones).
3. Check `carrier-parcel-templates-list` and `user-parcel-templates-list` for flat-rate and saved templates.
4. Call `shipments-create` per profile on the same route.
5. Compare: cheapest rate, carrier options, fastest option per profile. Note where flat-rate templates beat custom dimensions and where dimensional weight causes price jumps.

## Carrier Comparison

1. Call `shipments-create` for the route.
2. Group the `rates` array by `provider`.
3. Per carrier: cheapest service, fastest service, number of service levels, price range.

---

## Historical Cost Optimization

1. Call `shipments-list` and `transactions-list` to get past activity.
2. Cross-reference: what the user paid vs. what alternatives were available.
3. Identify patterns: carrier concentration, service-level mismatch, consistent overpayment.
4. For a sample of shipments with tracking numbers, call `tracking-status-get` to check actual vs. estimated delivery times.
5. If fewer than 5 successful transactions exist (not just shipments -- shipments are rate quotes, transactions represent actual spend), redirect to forward-looking analysis.

## Output Conventions

Write reports to the `analysis/` directory. Create it if it does not exist. Include both markdown and CSV. CSV must have a header row. Markdown must include a timestamp and input parameters.

## Quick Reference

**Cost analysis:**
`carrier-accounts-list` -> `shipments-create` (per destination) -> read `rates` arrays -> write report

**Carrier comparison:**
`shipments-create` -> group `rates` by `provider` -> summarize

**Historical review:**
`shipments-list` + `transactions-list` -> cross-reference -> `tracking-status-get` (sample) -> write report
